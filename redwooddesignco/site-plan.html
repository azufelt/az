      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Ashley! I help tell unique stories through handcrafted,
        solid-wood home decor signs. Incorporating skilled design and
        typography, mixed with a passion for modern interiors, my designs will
        allow the hallways in your home to come to life and truly speak your
        story! These pieces are a simple way to remind your family to slow down,
        enjoy the good times, build the relationships, be kind, and love hard.
        Don't we all need a peaceful escape from the world? A gentle reminder
        that the story you are creating is YOURS! If your walls spoke, what
        story would they tell?
      </p>

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/463f3a-8a817c-bcb8b1-f4f3ee-ead1c7-4e5f1b-e0afa0"
        target="_blank"
        >https://coolors.co/463f3a-8a817c-bcb8b1-f4f3ee-ead1c7-4e5f1b-e0afa0</a
      >

      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>
          <td class="primary">#F4F3EE</td>
          <td class="secondary">#BCB8B1</td>
          <td class="accent1">#463F3A</td>
          <td class="accent2">#EAD1C7</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Playfair Display
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this for the Heading font because it has a sophisticated
        element. Being a serif font it lends toward a little bit more formal or
        high-end product. It subtly tells the user that this is a site and brand
        that is trustworthy.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Montserrat
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Montserrat is a great pairing with Playfair Display. Because it is a
        sans-serif font it is easier to read for paragraphs and descriptions.
        Also the glyph or character size matches similarly to the heading font,
        reflecting a similar regalness. The juxtiposition of having a serif font
        for the heading and sans-serif for the paragraphs allows the user to
        easily distinguish between heading/description.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        Chalkboard -$85 Make lists, write menus, keep schedules, draw pictures.
        Anything you can dream up a chalkboard will bring to life. Let it be the
        center of your home command station and keep everything on track —even
        the occasional love note.
      </p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Who says farmhouse decor can’t be fresh, fun, & meaningful? Help your
        walls make a statement!
      </p>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
