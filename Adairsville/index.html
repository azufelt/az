              CARTERSVILLE, GA — Memorial Day is a holiday people in
              Cartersville, Bartow County and across America look forward to
              every year as the start of summer. It also gives people a chance
              to look back, as the final Monday in May is a day to remember all
              American lives lost during military service. Here are five things
              to know about the history of Memorial Day:
              <br /><br />
              1. It Was Originally Called Decoration Day: Remembering veterans
              who died while in military service in late May dates back to 1868,
              when Gen. John A. Logan called for a day of remembrance to honor
              the Northern lives lost amid battle during the Civil War that had
              ended just a few years earlier, according to History.com. Logan
              called it "Decoration Day," which it was known as for several
              years. As time passed, more and more people called it Memorial
              Day, History.com reported, and it became a federal holiday in
              1971.
              <br /><br />
              2. Local Events: The Noble Hill-Wheeler Memorial Center is hosting
              a Grab and Go Fish Fry to benefit the Land Project. Plates of fish
              and chicken, baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad, homemade cake
              and homemade fried pies go for a donation of $10. Call ahead to
              place orders at 770-382-3392.
              <br /><br />
              3. Birthplace Of Memorial Day: The Memorial Day holiday tradition
              in Waterloo, New York, dates back even longer than Logan's call
              for a day of remembrance. Waterloo first celebrated on May 5,
              1866, as local businesses closed and residents decorated the
              graves of fallen soldiers with flowers and flags, according to
              History.com.
