            On the night of April 6th, 1862, a shadowy character named James
            Andrews walked into the Third Division headquarters and introduced
            himself to Union General Ormsby Mitchel. They met to discuss what
            would eventually become one of the most well-known events of the
            Civil War, the Great Locomotive Chase. This daring plan was
            originally called “Andrews’ Raid”. Andrews, a long time Union
            sympathizer who was a spy in search of personal profit, proposed
            that he and his “raiders” should be authorized to wreck the Western
            & Atlantic Railroad in exchange for a large amount of money. This
            plan helped Mitchel immensely, since his division was planning on
            capturing the important rail hub in Chattanooga. Disabling the W&A
            Railroad, would make his job much simpler. If the railroad was taken
            out of commission, Chattanooga would be cut off from the south and
            the city would be an easy target. To surprise the enemy, Mitchel and
            Andrews agreed to synchronize their actions for April 11. Andrews
            selected volunteers from 3 regiments under Mitchel’s command. He
            asked specifically for a few soldiers who could handle a locomotive.
            Three men were picked specifically as a result: Private William
            Knight, Corporal Martin Jones Hawkins, and Private Wilson Brown all
            had experience on railroads. They were given civilian clothing and
            told to travel in small groups. They were to reassemble in Marietta,
            GA., on April 10 and hijack a train for Chattanooga the following
            morning. Their plan was to hijack a train headed north, then along
            the way tear up tracks, cut telegraph lines, and burn bridges.

            This depot was built in 1847 about a mile from the center of
            Adairsville. The depot was so vital to the town that the entire town
            relocated to be closer to it. At one time, Adairsville was the home
            of a major repair facility for Western & Atlantic railroad. During
            the Civil War, the Greal Locomotive Chase came through Adairsville.
            <br /><br />

            Service stopped at the depot in the 1960s. In the Mid 90's, most of
            the historic area of Adairsville went though a restoration project
            and the entire area is on the National Register of Historic Places.
            Today the depot is open as the Adairsville Rail Depot Age of Steam
            Museum and as a welcome center.
