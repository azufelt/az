        <h3>The Drizzly Bear</h3>
        <p>
          The name of this weather site is
          <em>The Drizzly Bear</em>. The site name is a simple and catchy play
          on words, which will be entertaining, but respectable to the target
          audience. <br /><br />Because of it's weather-centered nature it has
          drizzly, rain as it's center, incorporates "bear" because that is an
          animal commonly found in and around the local area.
        </p>

      <div class="mediacard">
        <h2 class="headline1">Purpose:</h2>
        <p>
          This site will be a place that brings community members together
          â€”bridging the gap between community as a whole and the individuals it
          represents. <br /><br />Visitors to this site will be able to get
          local weather updates and weather related alerts such as pending
          storms, local fire conditions like possible burn bans or emergency
          alerts. They will also be able to see information regarding upcoming
          community events and happenings around town, highlights and final
          scores from the local high School sports teams. Information
          regardinging area state parks would be able to be accessed as well.
          <br /><br />There may even be a local buy & sell page. From time to
          time special promotions will occur such as town parades, temporary art
          exhibits and other cultural events.

        <p>
          This domain is easy enough to be remembered, and has no special
          characters or spellings, which can be confusing to a site visitor.
          Also, because it is not an official town-sponsored page, it uses a
          .com in the URL.

        <p class="paragraph">
          The logo combines a few enjoyable elements together: It visually
          represents the name of the site "The Drizzly Bear". It has a slight
          playful feel to it, but not overwhelmingly childish. The bear is
          wearing a tie which gives a nod toward the working, "white-collar"
          class demographic, which fits the target audience.
