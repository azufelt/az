        <p class="paragraph">
          <span class="dropletter">T</span>he Joss & Main site is a perfect
          example of repetition! Instantly upon arriving at their mobile web
          homepage, two ideas of repetition are encountered. <br /><br />The
          first is the repetitive long, horizontal, shades-of-black banner bars
          that stretch across the screen view. Each of these bars lists a
          different navigation function for the user, but the options have been
          simplified by unifying their visual qualities. <br /><br />
          Further down the scroll, the user will find a plethora of navigation
          options. Each option is listed in an orderly fashion, paired with a a
          simplified icon representing the correlating shopping department.
          â€”Much like a shopper would find within a physical store shopping
          experience. <br /><br />
          Instead of becoming overwhelmed by choices, the user can quickly
          decide which department they are searching for and within seconds are
          able to navigate accordingly.

          Pottery Barn<br />
          <a

        <p class="paragraph">
          <span class="dropletter">P</span>ottery Barn utilizes the Law of
          Proximity on their mobile web homepage. It is further supported by the
          Law of Similarity. <br /><br />
          The designer has grouped similar items close to one another, as well
          as in the same colored box. For instance, the top gray banner is
          multiple brands that are branches of the main company, so if a user
          wanted to navigate easily to them, it will be easy to decipher that
          they are all of the company's other brands. <br /><br />
          Moving down the homepage we can see that the white box has many
          different black-lined icons grouped. Users have come to expect that
          these icons will be found close to one another (search tool, favorite
          items, hamburger drop-down menu). <br /><br />
          Followed immediately by a black banner box that groups together three
          ideas that revolve around shipping. And then of course our main visual
          box is comprised of a background image showcasing their newest
          product, and a black button that takes you directly to their shopping.
          <br /><br />
          Each of the sections show that the site designers planned accordingly
          to have like items share proximal real estate, simplifying the users'
          experience.

          MAGNOLIA<br />
          <a class="textlink" href="https://magnolia.com/" target="_blank"

          src="/lesson2/lesson2images/magnolia-mobile-web-homepage.jpg"
          alt="home page of magnolia company on a mobile device"
        />

        <p class="paragraph">
          <span class="dropletter">I</span>nteracting with the MAGNOLIA website
          on a mobile device couldn't be simpler or more refreshing! It makes
          great use of negative space throughout the site but doesn't limit it
          to being just plain white. <br /><br />
          The first image that appears on the homepage even reinforces a
          pleasing amount of negative space. Because of the generous use of
          negative space, our eyes are at rest and we are directed exactly where
          to go: the "SHOP NOW" button that appears above the fold, in bold
          black. <br /><br />
          By keeping the surrounding background free of any visual elements,
          other than the title, the viewer does not have to wonder where to
          navigate next, or where they should start shopping.
          <br /><br />
          As the user maneuvers through this site on a mobile device, their
          finger will naturally fall on the over-sized "SHOP NOW" button, which
          sports a generous amount of padding reinforcing the simplicity of
          their shopping experience.
