              The 48th Great Loco­motive Chase Festival will sprawl across
              downtown Adairsville from Friday through Sunday. The festival
              celebrates Adairsville’s role in the railroad drama of 1862 when
              Yankee spies, led by James Andrews, stole a Confederate locomotive
              before they abandoned the train near Tunnel Hill. The festival was
              started in 1968 when Marion Lacey, then principal at Adairsville
              High School, sought something to replace the school’s Hal­low­een
              festival. The festival features carnival rides, arts and crafts
              booths, food vendors, entertainment on two stages, a Saturday
              morning parade and Saturday night fireworks. Mayor Kenneth Carson
              described the event as sort of a citywide homecoming celebration
              that doubles as a “unification mechanism.” Musical entertainment
              will be staged at the gazebo on the city square throughout the
              festival. Festival hours are Friday from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.,
              Saturday from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m.
              Tickets are $3 and one admission fee allows visitors access to
              events all three days. There is no admission for the Sunday
              afternoon part of the festival.

            On the night of April 6th, 1862, a shadowy character named James
            Andrews walked into the Third Division headquarters and introduced
            himself to Union General Ormsby Mitchel. They met to discuss what
            would eventually become one of the most well-known events of the
            Civil War, the Great Locomotive Chase. This daring plan was
            originally called “Andrews’ Raid”.
            <br /><br />Andrews, a long time Union sympathizer who was a spy in
            search of personal profit, proposed that he and his “raiders” should
            be authorized to wreck the Western & Atlantic Railroad in exchange
            for a large amount of money. This plan helped Mitchel immensely,
            since his division was planning on capturing the important rail hub
            in Chattanooga. <br /><br />Disabling the W&A Railroad, would make
            his job much simpler. If the railroad was taken out of commission,
            Chattanooga would be cut off from the south and the city would be an
            easy target. To surprise the enemy, Mitchel and Andrews agreed to
            synchronize their actions for April 11. Andrews selected volunteers
            from 3 regiments under Mitchel’s command. He asked specifically for
            a few soldiers who could handle a locomotive. <br /><br />Three men
            were picked specifically as a result: Private William Knight,
            Corporal Martin Jones Hawkins, and Private Wilson Brown all had
            experience on railroads. They were given civilian clothing and told
            to travel in small groups. They were to reassemble in Marietta, GA.,
            on April 10 and hijack a train for Chattanooga the following
            morning. Their plan was to hijack a train headed north, then along
            the way tear up tracks, cut telegraph lines, and burn bridges.
